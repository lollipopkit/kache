/// Bump this when cache key logic changes in a way that could have produced
/// incorrect entries. All entries from previous versions become unreachable.
///
/// v3: PathNormalizer replaces the ad-hoc `normalize_flags` (CWD-only,
/// fooled by macOS `/tmp` ↔ `/private/tmp` symlinks). Strips $HOME,
/// $CARGO_HOME, $CARGO_TARGET_DIR and the workspace root with stable
/// sentinels.
///
/// v4: `--remap-path-prefix` injection switched from a single
/// CWD-based mapping to multi-prefix using PathNormalizer's full rule
/// set. Output binaries now embed sentinel paths in DWARF / PDB
/// instead of machine-local prefixes — bytes are byte-incompatible
/// with v3 single-prefix outputs, so the bump invalidates v3 entries.
///
/// v5: `--emit` is now hashed. `cargo check` emits `metadata`
/// (`.rmeta`); `cargo build` emits `link` (`.rlib`). Same crate with
/// everything else the key hashed identical → same key, so a check's
/// metadata-only entry could be served to a build needing the
/// `.rlib`. The composition changed, so v4 entries are invalidated.
///
/// v6: `PathNormalizer` gained a rule for the rustc working directory
/// → `<WORKSPACE>`, so `--remap-path-prefix` now also rewrites DWARF
/// `DW_AT_comp_dir` (rustc records the raw CWD there). Debug builds
/// previously leaked the build path through `comp_dir`; the remapped
/// output is byte-incompatible with v5, so the bump invalidates it.
///
/// v7: `-Clinker=<path>` is no longer part of the key. mozbuild (and any
/// build that points rustc at a bootstrapped toolchain) sets
/// `-Clinker=/abs/path/to/clang++`, which previously baked the
/// machine-local path into the key — every clone produced a distinct
/// key for the same crate (Firefox bench measured 0.2% cross-clone key
/// stability). The linker's *identity* is still hashed via
/// `linker:<--version output>` (see `get_linker_identity`), which is
/// path-independent. Existing v6 entries become unreachable.
///
/// v8: `RUSTFLAGS` is whitespace-normalized before hashing. Cargo / mach
/// assemble the env value with cosmetically-varying whitespace across
/// compile profiles (extra spaces between flags, trailing spaces); the
/// raw string previously produced different cache keys for
/// semantically-identical flag sets. Observed on the Firefox bench as
/// the dominant source of "leaf" cache-key divergence — fixing it
/// stabilizes ~18 leaf crates and their non-mozbuild dependents.
///
/// v9: dep-info blobs use an explicit kache sentinel instead of `./`
/// for stored project-root paths. The old marker was ambiguous with
/// ordinary make depfile paths such as `../foo.h`, whose second dot
/// contains a `./` substring and could be expanded incorrectly on
/// restore.
///
/// v10: source files are hashed in content-hash order instead of
/// absolute-path order (a build-script-generated file under `OUT_DIR`
/// sorted differently once the build tree moved, leaking path-order into
/// the key and breaking relocated cache hits — #201). The update order
/// changes on EVERY platform, not just Windows, so the same crate hashes
/// to a different key; bump to invalidate v9 entries cleanly rather than
/// leave a silent partial invalidation. (Env-dep values are also now
/// un-escaped, which can change Windows OUT_DIR keys.)
///
/// v11: previously-unkeyed codegen-affecting inputs are now folded in —
/// `--sysroot`, native link flags (`-L`/`-l`), `-Z` flags, and the
/// CONTENTS of a custom `--target` JSON spec. Also unifies the cc recipe
/// onto this same constant (was a separate `CC_CACHE_KEY_VERSION`).
///
/// v12: cc resolved `-###` tokens are path-normalized through the same
/// prefix maps as the preprocessor stdout before hashing (were hashed
/// raw). Absolute build paths in those tokens — `-I` dirs, `-D` defines
/// like `FIREFOX_ICO="/abs/.../firefox.ico"`, input/`-o` paths — made the
/// cc key path-dependent, so two builds of the same TU at different paths
/// missed cross-machine / cross-clone (Firefox bench: `resolved_token`
/// was a top cross-clone divergence).
///
/// v13: cc prefix-map roots now also derive from the `-I` include dirs,
/// not just (cwd, source-dir). Objdir-generated TUs (`Unified_cpp_*`)
/// compile a source that lives IN the build dir, so the old derivation
/// collapsed to a narrow objdir subdir and leaked `__FILE__` paths into
/// `dist/include` + the source tree (Firefox bench: `preprocessed` was the
/// top cross-clone divergence, ~1000 TUs). The include dirs span the repo,
/// so their common ancestor with cwd reaches the repo root, making
/// cross-checkout cc caching work automatically. (`KACHE_BASE_DIR` is an
/// explicit override; `KACHE_CC_PATH_NORMALIZE=0` disables it all.)
///
/// v14: the per-checkout `from` side of `--remap-path-prefix` (and the clang
/// `-f*-prefix-map` family) is collapsed to a `<REMAP_FROM>` sentinel in the
/// RUSTFLAGS / CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS key inputs. A build system's own path
/// remapping (Firefox `--enable-path-remapping`) emits
/// `--remap-path-prefix=/abs/clone-a/=/topsrcdir/` — the flag that makes the
/// *artifact* path-portable was itself making the *key* path-dependent, since
/// FROM is the checkout path. Keying on the stable TO target (and scrubbing
/// FROM) lets the build's declared remap and kache's key agree (Firefox bench:
/// `RUSTFLAGS` was the top cross-clone divergence, 392 crates, after remapping
/// fixed the source/include! leak).
///
/// Single source of truth for both the rustc recipe (this module) and
/// the cc recipe ([`crate::compiler::cc`]). The two hash distinct labels
/// (`key_version:` vs `cc_key_version:`) and disjoint field layouts, so
/// their entries never collide regardless of this number — the version
/// only controls *invalidation*. One constant, one bump.
// v16 (kunobi-ninja/kache#324): length-prefix the free-text key fields (cfg,
// env-dep, codegen flag args) so a value containing the old `\n`/`=` delimiter
// can't be confused with an adjacent field's boundary.
//
// v17 (kunobi-ninja/kache#399): the `--remap-path-prefix` SENTINEL SET is no
// longer folded into the key — only the remap on/off choice (multi-prefix vs
// none) is. The set's membership depended on which machine-local dirs existed
// relative to the build, so it varied across machines and across relocations
// when the build tree lived inside one of those dirs (an out-of-tree build
// under the system tempdir dropped the <TMPDIR> rule by de-dupe, diverging the
// key). It was also redundant with the already-keyed normalized path fields.
// Dropping it fixes out-of-tree relocate misses on Windows and improves
// cross-machine key stability. Removing the per-sentinel fold changes the key
// bytes for every crate, so bump to invalidate v16 entries cleanly.
//
// v18 (kunobi-ninja/kache#431): a build-script `cargo:rustc-env=VAR=<path under
// OUT_DIR>` used purely as an `include!(env!("VAR"))` locator (e.g. typenum's
// TYPENUM_BUILD_CONSTS → `$OUT_DIR/consts.rs`) is now path-normalized in the
// key, like OUT_DIR itself. Previously only the literal var `OUT_DIR` (or a
// user-allowlisted name) qualified, so typenum — a foundational dep of the
// whole substrate/crypto stack — kept an absolute build path in its key and
// re-keyed per checkout, missing cross-clone. Normalizing it changes typenum's
// (and any such crate's) key bytes, so bump to invalidate v17 entries cleanly.
//
// v19 (kunobi-ninja/kache#471): a `-l static=` GNU archive is now folded via a
// build-path-PORTABLE member-content hash ([`crate::native_archive`]) instead of
// a whole-file hash. The `cc` crate names archive members by a hash of the
// absolute build path (`cafca65b…-quickjs.o` vs `4af22b2a…`) while the object
// bytes are identical, so the whole-file hash re-keyed per checkout and missed
// cross-clone (rquickjs-sys, wasm-opt-cc, …). The portable hash ignores those
// names; at v19, non-GNU/unparseable archives fell back to the whole-file hash.
// v24 revises that identity definition and adds bounded BSD parsing. Either way
// the static-lib key bytes changed here, so v19 invalidated v18 entries cleanly.
//
// v20 (kunobi-ninja/kache#480 follow-up): coverage builds now fold the raw local
// path identity into the key, like the `KACHE_RUSTC_PATH_NORMALIZE=0` opt-out
// already did. Coverage skips `--remap-path-prefix` (llvm-cov / tarpaulin need
// real paths in the profraw), so it bakes machine-local paths into DWARF while
// the rest of the key normalized its path inputs — two checkouts computed the
// same `remap:none` key and a shared cache could serve one checkout's real-path
// coverage artifact to another. Folding [`fold_unremapped_path_identity`] for
// coverage (not just the opt-out) changes coverage key bytes, so bump to
// invalidate v19 coverage entries cleanly.
//
// v21 (kunobi-ninja/kache#485): remap-path-prefix TARGETS changed from
// angle-bracket sentinels (`<WORKSPACE>`, `<CARGO_HOME>`, `<CC_ROOT>`, …) to
// resolvable absolute paths (`/proc/self/cwd` on Linux, `/rustc/<hash>`,
// `/kache/*`) so samply / the Firefox Profiler and debuggers can resolve cached
// sources without configuration. The targets are baked into DWARF/PDB and into
// functional bytes (rustc `file!()` / `#[track_caller]` / panic locations; the
// clang/gcc `__FILE__` via `-ffile-prefix-map`), so the produced artifacts
// differ even though the cache-key `normalize()` sentinels are unchanged. The
// rustc sentinel set is not folded into the key (v17/#399) and the cc target
// strings ARE hashed, so a single bump covers both and prevents new builds from
// being served old-sentinel artifacts. Bump to invalidate v20 entries cleanly.
//
// v22 (kunobi-ninja/kache#521): target_dir and workspace_root derivation for
// cross-compilation. Stripping the target triple from target_dir() when cross-compiling
// alters the path remapping prefix and dep-info rewriting anchor. Bumping the key version
// invalidates v21 cross-compiled cache entries cleanly.
//
// #647 deliberately needs no bump: rustc response files were refused under
// every existing version, while their expanded effective arguments key exactly
// like the equivalent inline argv and leave ordinary invocation keys unchanged.
//
// v23 (kunobi-ninja/kache#330): env-dep values under the build's own OUT_DIR
// (the literal OUT_DIR and typenum-style locator vars) now normalize to an
// `<OUT_DIR:{unit-dir}>`-relative sentinel instead of running through the
// generic prefix rules. The generic rules kept per-location components inside
// the value when `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` sits outside the workspace (the derived
// workspace root is the target dir's parent, so `<WORKSPACE>` swallowed the
// target path), diverging keys across build locations for content-identical
// compiles. Cargo's per-unit directory component stays in the sentinel — a
// generated file can observe its own remapped path via `file!()`, so units
// differing only by unit hash must not collide. Bump so v22 entries with the
// old spelling invalidate cleanly.
//
// v24 (kunobi-ninja/kache#691): BSD / Darwin archives gain a bounded structural
// parser, while both GNU and BSD digests now retain exact effective member
// names and timestamps. rustc preserves member names when bundling archives
// into rlibs, and linkers can observe `archive-path(member)`, so ignoring `cc`'s
// path-derived prefixes was not safe across producer/consumer invocations.
// Unsupported non-thin archives use a lexical-path-bound digest; thin archives
// make the invocation uncacheable because their external bytes are absent from
// the container. This intentionally gives up #471/#691 cross-clone reuse when
// member names differ, preferring false misses over false hits.
//
// v25 (kunobi-ninja/kache#730): the Windows dep-info rewrite (#733) is escape-
// aware per line, but the entries the OLD rewrite already stored under v24 stay
// reachable, and they are not merely stale — they are build-breakers. The old
// whole-content `Relativize` could split an escaped `\\` pair while anchoring,
// so the CORRUPTION IS BAKED INTO THE STORED BYTES: the fixed `Expand` cannot
// repair an orphan escape, and cargo hard-rejects the restored `.d` with
// "unknown escape character", failing the compile on every hit (the nightly
// Firefox/Windows bench reproduced exactly this). The mixed fleet is exposed
// both ways too — a pre-#733 client restoring a correctly stored entry runs the
// old unescaped `Expand` and re-corrupts it. Both directions share key v24, so
// only a bump makes them unreachable. Cost is one cold rebuild, which v0.13.0
// users (key v22) already pay crossing to this release regardless.
//
// v26 (kunobi-ninja/kache#760): source identity now folds each normalized path
// together with its content hash. v25 retained only the sorted multiset of
// contents, so swapping two module bodies (or renaming an include_dir asset)
// could preserve the key while changing the compiled program. The same bump
// also makes old dep-info blobs that retain donor-worktree absolute paths
// unreachable; v26 stores separate target/cwd sentinels and re-roots both.
//
// v27 (kunobi-ninja/kache#808): generated dep-info sources beneath an
// in-workspace Cargo target now belong to the effective target before the
// higher-ranked workspace source root. v26 could store
// `__kache_workspace__/target_1/.../OUT_DIR/private.rs`; another concurrent
// Cargo process using target_2 expanded that donor suffix, failed
// validate-on-hit, evicted the entry, and recompiled. The stored dep-info bytes
// change, so the bump makes every incorrectly owned v26 blob unreachable.
//
// v28: every rustc lint-setting flag and `--check-cfg` now participates in
// the outcome key. v27 ignored `-W`/`-A` and check-cfg expectation sets, so a
// successful compile could be replayed after an allow was removed, a warning
// was enabled beneath a deny group, or accepted cfg values were tightened.
// v0.16.0 shipped v27, so the bump also protects mixed fleets from consuming
// already-persisted false-success entries.
//
// v29: native host-loaded links now pin the objects the driver actually
// places (Linux CRT/startup + libc hashes) and the macOS SDK identity
// (version + build), failing closed to passthrough when those essentials
// cannot be resolved. macOS debug links also inject ld64 `-oso_prefix` so
// `N_OSO` paths are relative to `--out-dir` rather than checkout-local.
// WASM admission is explicit for rustc-bundled self-contained targets.
// Shared with the cc recipe, so local and remote Rust/C entries from v28
// are unreachable; `kache gc --stale-schema` reclaims them.
//
// v30: native Windows MSVC links now pin the validated link.exe/lld-link and
// cl banners, selected architecture, MSVC/SDK/UCRT versions, and hashes of
// the selected CRT/UCRT libraries and of every `-l` library resolved through
// `-L`/`/LIBPATH`/LIB. Explicit `-C link-arg` input files (`.lib`, `.a`,
// `.obj`, `.o`, `.res`, `.def`, `.exp`, `.manifest`) and file-carrying LINK
// options (`/DEF`, `/DEFAULTLIB`, `/MANIFESTINPUT`, `/MANIFESTFILE`,
// `/PDBSTRIPPED`, ...) are keyed only as text, so they fail closed to
// passthrough. Windows GNU, cross-target, and metadata invocations remain
// unprobed. Existing Windows linked-output keys did not contain this
// identity, so invalidate them rather than mix schemas.

    // It must stay an explicit allowlist: for CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR and arbitrary
    // user vars the path-only test alone is not valid (normal crate sources
    // already live under the manifest dir, so normalizing it would recreate
    // #167). The `path_is_only_used_for_includes` gate is then applied on top,

    // rather than used to locate a source file.
    //
    // Third built-in case (kunobi-ninja/kache#431): a build script can set
    // `cargo:rustc-env=VAR=<absolute path under OUT_DIR>` and the crate then does
    // `include!(env!("VAR"))` — e.g. typenum's TYPENUM_BUILD_CONSTS points at
    // `$OUT_DIR/consts.rs`. Such a var is functionally identical to OUT_DIR: its
    // value is build-generated, ephemeral, and only locates a generated include,
    // so it is exactly as safe to normalize. Keeping it absolute makes the crate
    // (typenum, a foundational substrate/crypto dep) re-key per checkout path,
    // missing cross-clone. We gate it on the value living UNDER the build's
    // OUT_DIR — the precise property that makes OUT_DIR safe and that
    // CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR (the #167 hazard) does NOT have — so it widens
    // eligibility without re-opening #167. The same include-only proof below
    // still applies, so a VAR pointing under OUT_DIR but baked as a runtime
    // value is still kept absolute.
    // CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR is refused in every form, listed or not: rustc can
    // embed it in crate metadata and generated code, and a crate's own sources
    // always live under it, so the include proof below is trivially satisfied
    // and normalizing it restores another checkout's path (#167).
